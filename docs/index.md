## GNSS-based TEC anomaly detection

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alikhosravi/BBox/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

The changes in the ionosphere layer before, during, or after the earthquake have long been an earthquke precursor among scientists. The anomalies in Total Electron Content (TEC) of the ionosphere layer before, during, or after have been reoported by scholars. 
A wide variety of methods have been utilized for detecting anomalies in TEC time series. Although the methods have different mechanisms, all of them construct a normal profile of TEC initially, then identify values that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. Regarding the ionosphere nature that is always affected by different factors, finding a normal trend is a complex even impossible task. Thus, anomaly detection results have probably too many false alarms (having normal values identified as anomalies).

Here, we identify anomalies regarding the fact that anomalies are very different and rare. We calculate the TEC anomoalies using an unsupervised  machine learning algorithm, isolation forest.
